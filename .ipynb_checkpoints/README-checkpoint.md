# Notebook Overview

The notebook is divided into two main sections:

## Random Forest
This section demonstrates how to train a Random Forest classifier on the Iris dataset. It then predicts the class labels for the test set and calculates the accuracy of the classifier.

## SVMs
This section demonstrates how to train an SVM classifier on the Iris dataset. It then predicts the class labels for the test set and calculates the accuracy of the classifier.

The notebook also includes a histogram that compares the accuracy scores of the Random Forest and SVM classifiers.

# Results

- The accuracy of the Random Forest classifier was 0.89.
- The accuracy of the SVM classifier was 0.725.

The histogram shows the distribution of accuracy scores for both classifiers.

# Conclusion

Based on the results, the Random Forest classifier outperforms the SVM classifier in this case. However, it's important to note that the choice of classifier should depend on the specific problem and dataset at hand.

You can find the complete code and analysis in the attached python notebook.
